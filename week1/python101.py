## Coin flip. Write a function that will "flip a coin" and print the result. There should be a 50/50 chance of getting heads or tails.
# import random
# wants_flip = input("Flip a coin? ")
# while (wants_flip == "y" or wants_flip == "yes"):
#     is_heads = random.randint(0, 2) % 2 == 0  # 50% chance heads, 50% tails
#     if is_heads:
#         print("heads")
#     else:
#         print("tails")
#     wants_flip = input("Flip a coin? ")


##* Even Odd
# Write a function that when given a number as an input will return true if the number is odd and false if the number is even.
# Write a script that asks the user for a number. Pass the number to the function and then print a message to the console that informs the user if the number was even or odd
# num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
# if (num % 2) == 0:
#    print("{0} is Even".format(num))
# else:
#    print("{0} is Odd".format(num))
    
    
##* Dice Roller
#Write a function that takes two numbers as arguments, then returns a random whole number between those two numbers.
#Write a script that tells the user that we are going to roll the dice but we need to know how many sides they have. Ask them for a number between 2 and 20. Pass the number 1 and the number from the user to the function, then print a message that shows the result
