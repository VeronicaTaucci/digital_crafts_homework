# Write a function that takes a number as an input.
# Have it create an empty array and then push a string into the array as many
# times as the input number. If the input is anything other than a positive
# integer return an empty array
#
# Name the function "finalFunction"

# num1 = int(input("What is the number?"))
# def finalFunction():
#     arr = []
#     string1 = "hello"
#     for i in range(num1):
#         arr.append(string1)
#     return arr

# print(finalFunction())
